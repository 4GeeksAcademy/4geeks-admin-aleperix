## Better student tracking

We have shiped today 3 main features that together will make tracking students progress a lot easier: Better student<>cohort report, a student watchlist and adding notes.

- Student Report: We have created a dashboard where you can read all the details you need to know about a student performance within a cohort. You can find the "Cohort<>Student Report" button on any cohort details, specifically on the list of cohort members. You can also find it on the watchlist.
- Watch students: There is now a centralized wachlist were you can keep track of the students that need your help the most. On the cohort or student view, when listing the members of a cohort, you can click on "watch" to any of the student members, that will add them into a separate watchlist were all the students being watched are listed, no matter the cohort.
- Student educational and career notes: From the Cohort<>Student report you are not able to add notes to students.
